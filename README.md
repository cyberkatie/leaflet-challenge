#Part 1: Creating the Earthquake Visualization

* Acquired the dataset from the USGS GeoJSON feed
* Imported and visualized the data by doing the following:
  * Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
  * The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
  * Included popups that provides additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
  * Created a legend that provides context for your map data.
